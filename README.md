# Bitwise-Manipulation-Game
Using the shortest number of manipulations convert 1 byte to another - made using Python3

# Requirements
  - **Level 1** 
    - Allow the user to logical shift a binary number
  - **Level 2** 
    - Allow the user to arithmetic shift a binary number
  - **Level 3**
    - Show the effect the shifting has by showing the denary values before and after the shifts. 
    - Allow the user to bit mask the binary using AND OR  
  - **Level 4**
    - Create a two bytes of binary and record the number of bitwise manipulations needed to convert between the two 
  - **Level 5**
    - Allow signed binary
    - Make it graphical 
  - **Level 6**
    - The program works out the shortest number of steps to change between the two numbers and shows the answer.
  - **Level 7**
    - The program shows an animation of the bits moving.
